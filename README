# Advance-Security-system-using-Encrypted-password-

With increasing demand of security now a day it is very critical issue, there for user   authentication is one of the important topics in information security to protect userâ€™s privacy. So we have to develop an application for the peoples who want to secure their system from unauthenticated users. If somebody have hacked or find password of our computer by any mean and trying to access our system, then this application will not allow him to do that. When any unauthenticated user will enter password and clicks on login button the application will change password of system and restart the system. Before restarting the system application will capture snap of user and send it on the email id of admin with new password. Actually we will provide a dummy login screen to the users after he enters in operating system. If admin wants to login in system he have to use keystrokes for actual login screen. If admin enter login credentials in this screen application will allow him to access the system.
